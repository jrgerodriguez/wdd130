                <h2 class="firstplace-title">Uyuni Salt Flats</h2>
                <p class="firstplace-p">Salar de Uyuni is the largest salt flat on Earth, it is often called the “world’s largest mirror” because during rainy season (January to February), a thin layer of dead calm water transforms the salt into a big mirror with expectacular reflections where it is easy to lose the perspective of things like moutains. When visiting Salar de Uyuni make sure to wear sunglasses, a hat and a jacket because the place is cold, as well, it is very convenient to wear rubber boots.</p>

                <p class="secondplace-p">Rock Desert is another amazing destination inside the bolivian desert, you should not forget your sun screen lotion here. Weather varies, it can be pretty warm during the day and get really cold at night, take your jacket with you and make sure you have at least two layers of clothes on. Wearing boots will be also a smart decision while shoes with thin soles may be uncomfortable. There is a small village inside the desert where tour operators accomodate tourists.</p>
