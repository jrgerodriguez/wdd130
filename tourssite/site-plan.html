        WHAT IS OUR COMMUNITY? 
My community is formed by people who are looking for an Andean adventure in the Andes mountains visiting its outstanding mountains and breath-taking landscapes, however we know that the problems we often come across as tourists is that it is not possible to find accurate and complete information and not because this can not be found on internet on sites like Google, Youtube, Instagram, Trip Advisor and more, but because there is so much information posted out there that it makes it hard to find what is appropriate general information and what is just information that influencers, vloggers or youtubers have just shared based on their own experiences in the time they got to travel without considering that other tourists may be planning on visiting those same places during different times of the year which also means different seasons and experiences. 

WE ARE NOT A TOUR OPERATOR
Yet we inform about trips, we do not cover rates and prices of tours because the purpose of our website is to inform about the life in these magical places since there are countless tour operators already that will provide this information, again, our main purpose is for travelers to know what other travelers have learned about these parts of the world. It is good to remember that we are not a tour operator, however, we will let people contact us if they need more detailed information or any contact for a tour operator in the area to add more to their experience but the main reason for this website is to make sure people will know what to expect when they are there, we do it because we believe as tourists we all are united in the same purpose.

PLACES YOU SHOULD VISIT IN BOLIVIA

UYUNI SALT FLATS
Salar de Uyuni is the largest salt flat on Earth, it is often called the “world’s largest mirror” because during rainy season (January to February), a thin layer of dead calm water transforms the falt into a big mirror with expectacular reflections where it is easy to lose the perspective of thing like moutains. 
When visiting Salar de Uyuni make sure to wear sunglasses, a hat and a jacket because the place is cold, as well, it is very convenient to wear rubber boots. 

ROCK DESERT
Rock Desert is another amazing destination inside the bolivian desert, you should not forget your sun screen lotion here. Weather varies, it can be pretty warm during the day and get really cold at night, take your jacket with you and make sure you have at least two layers of clothes on. 
Wearing boots will be also a smart decision while shoes with thin soles may be uncomfortable. 

BOLIVIAN DESERT
The weather inside the bolivian desert is a lot like the rock desert’s, the desert is home to some of the most beaautiful landscapes and mountains that you will ever see, here you can also find llamas, foxes, coyotes and rabbits, tourist are also amazed by the numerous and colorful lagoons, volcanoes, spring waters and geysers found in the area.

You should walk slow here, as oxygen levels are lower due to its altitude but nothing dangerous will happen.
