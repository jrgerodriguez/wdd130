                <p class="community-p">Our community is formed by people who are looking for an Andean adventure in the Andes mountains and visit its breath-taking landscapes. We know that as tourists it is sometimes not possible to find accurate and complete information because there is too much content posted out there that it makes it hard to find what is appropriate general information and what is just information that influencers, vloggers or youtubers have just shared based on their own experiences in the time they got to travel without considering what other tourists may be planning for different times of the year which also means different seasons and experiences.</p>

                <h2 class="operator-title">We are not a tour operator</h2>
                <p class="operator-p">Yet we inform about trips, we do not cover rates and prices of tours because the purpose of our website is to inform about these magical places, there are countless tour operators already that will provide this information, again, our main purpose is for travelers to know what other travelers have learned about these parts of the world. It is good to remember that we are not a tour operator, however, we will let people contact us if they need more detailed information, we will share what we have experienced.</p>
